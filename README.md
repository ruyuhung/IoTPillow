<h4>•	Lives of Data and flow chart<br/></h4>
<p>For ZEEQ Smart Pillow, it uses three chunks of sensor, speaker, vibration motor in a pillow. Like other internet of things, it connects with a mobile phone application. Through the application you can further connect your pillow to your favorite music player, such as, apple music or Spotify. Therefore, it becomes an alarm if you want it to be. In addition to music player function, the most important functionality is its sleeping cycle analysis ability. All the data is collected inside the APP with several visualization charts and diagrams.</p><br/>
Last but not the least function is the anti-snoring vibration motor. In other words, the pillow can also sense the decimal of your snore and decides whether to give vibration and let you automatically change the position. It contains a small microphone inside the pillow which could detect the snoring throughout the night.<br/>

<h4>•	Replicate and Replace, Critique</h4>
<p>In general, I feel the product design is quite well. Nevertheless, the functionality and user experience might need some slight improvement. It might be better to further synchronize the pillow with a real-time clock, such as the owner’s calendar or schedule. In the original function, user has to click ‘start sleep’ to activate the sensor. However, in real life, people sometimes fall asleep in an exhausting condition and it’s hard for them to even open the app and press activate. My suggestion is to install a timer in the circuit board and also add another function of activate the sensor through one movement, for example, a great hit of the pillow. In that way, users could set up a usual sleeping time range and the pillow could automatically activate the sensors. Though, it needs to connect with the Internet all the time might lose the battery power. In its usual situation, it should be in a low-power mode instead of activating the sensors all the time. </p>
